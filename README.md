# Website-UX-UI

## Repository Naming Convention

We follow a structured naming convention for our repositories to maintain clarity and consistency:

```
<project-name>-<scope>-<descriptor>
```

Examples:
- `KLPS-frontend-v1`: Frontend application for the KLPS project.
- `KLPS-api`: Backend API for KLPS.

Ensure new repositories adhere to this convention for better collaboration.
